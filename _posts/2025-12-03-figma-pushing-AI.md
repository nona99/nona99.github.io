## 1\. What's Happening in the Design Industry?

### 1-1. The "Faster, Faster" Speed ​​of the Times

In the past, the design process was relatively simple. Planners would outline requirements, designers would create wireframes and mockups, and publishers and developers would sequentially implement them. It was common for a single design cycle to take **several days or weeks**.

But now, things are completely different. Most services, including startups, commerce, SaaS, and content platforms, operate at the following speed:

- Landing pages, onboarding screens, and promotional areas are tested **multiple times a week**
- Marketing banners, thumbnails, and card news are produced **dozens per day**
- Product UIs are fine-tuned through **continuous A/B testing**

In other words, design is no longer a **one-time, pretty task** but rather a **task of continuously changing, testing, and optimizing performance**. The first challenge is that this pace is **difficult to handle by hand**.

### 1-2. Repetitive Work Has Exploded

When we look at the actual work of designers and developers, a significant portion is **repetitive work**, not **creative design**.

- Transforming similar layouts into multiple versions
- Continuously placing text boxes, buttons, input fields, etc.
- Replacing dummy text with real copy
- Resizing images, removing backgrounds, and unifying styles
- Duplicating the same screen in multiple languages

Before the introduction of AI, all of these processes were handled manually by humans. However, technology has now advanced to the point where **AI can significantly replace these repetitive tasks**. Various reports analyze that **the area where AI saves designers the most time is "simple, repetitive, and auxiliary tasks"**.

### 1-3. The AI ​​Design Tool Market Itself is Growing Explosively

According to global reports, **the AI-based design tool market is expected to grow by over 20% annually starting in 2024**, and AI-powered automation and assistance tools are rapidly increasing across UX/UI, web, and graphic design. In other words, "using AI in design" is no longer an option; it's becoming a **basic premise for the entire industry**.

In this trend, Figma can no longer simply remain a **canvas for creating design files**. To remain competitive as a design platform, it must connect the entire workflow from **idea → design → prototype → code → website** through AI.

## 2\. Why Figma Had No Choice but to Choose AI

### 2-1. Competitive tools are already moving towards an "AI-first" approach.

Looking at the design tool ecosystem, Figma isn't alone. Several competing services are already touting powerful AI capabilities.

- **Canva** – Image creation, background removal, Magic Design templates, auto-layout
- **Framer** – Automatic website creation using text prompts
- **Adobe** – Deeply integrating AI into Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro through [Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html)
- Numerous other **AI UI creation startups**

Conversely, **"design tools without AI" are losing ground in the market. Therefore, Figma officially announced **Figma AI** at [Config 2024](https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-recap/) in 2024, beginning the integration of AI across its products.

### 2-2. Adapting to the "Interactive, Prompt-Based" Design Flow

Figma's [Figma AI page](https://www.figma.com/ai/) clearly demonstrates a step beyond the traditional "mouse-based drawing" approach, moving towards **prompt-based design**.

![figma ai](/assets/img/post/figma2.png)

- **Figma Make** – A **prompt-to-app** tool that creates apps and web interfaces with prompts.
- **Code Layers** – Prompt-to-create interactions and animations without writing code.
- **Figma Sites** – Publish responsive websites directly from your designs.

This trend signals a shift from "design → development" to **a structure where design + code + AI meet in one space." Ultimately, Figma aims to become a hub where designers, publishers, developers, and planners work together through AI.

### 2-3. To reduce repetitive tasks and accelerate creative decision-making

The goal of Figma AI, as stated on Figma's official blog, is simple: "We will reduce the repetitive tasks that hinder designers' creativity and allow them to spend more time exploring ideas and making decisions."

Therefore, rather than replacing everything at once, Figma AI delves deeply into the areas where designers are most wasting time.

- Initial layout → Automatically generate drafts with **First Draft**
- Text input → Fill in with **AI text generation, rewrite, and translation**
- Image resource creation → Quickly secure with **Image generation and background removal**
- Layer naming and organization → Structure with **Automatic layer naming**

Thus, Figma is moving towards using AI to reduce "hands" and increase "heads."

## 3\. What Does Figma AI Actually Help You With?

### 3-1. First Draft — Transform Ideas into Designs Instantly

[First Draft](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/23955143044247-Use-First-Draft-with-Figma-AI) is the flagship feature of Figma AI. By simply entering a simple text prompt, Figma automatically generates a **wireframe or design draft**.

For example:

> "Light theme login screen, email/password input fields, two social login buttons, and a sign-up link at the bottom."

Even with this much detail, Figma automatically creates a **draft screen** with the placement of buttons, input fields, and text.** Rather than expecting a complete design right away, it's better to think of it as a **"feature that dramatically speeds up the visualization of ideas."**

### 3-2. Text Creation, Rewriting, and Translation — No More Lorem Ipsum

Figma AI also offers the ability to **create, summarize, rewrite, and translate** text directly within the design canvas.

- "Make it a little shorter and more casual" → Adjust the tone of buttons and text
- "Translate it into Korean" → Create a multilingual UI draft
- "Write the shopping cart text here" → Automatically generate copy that feels like a real service

Thanks to this feature, designers no longer have to rely on planners for all text and can quickly design "screens that are close to the actual service".

### 3-3. Image Creation and Editing — Particularly Useful for Teams with Limited Resources

[Figma AI](https://www.figma.com/ai/) supports image generation based on OpenAI's image model and Google Gemini, allowing you to create images, remove backgrounds, and style them directly within the canvas.

- Automatically generate backgrounds that match your product images
- Remove backgrounds and replace them with a different color
- Easily create illustrations and icons for thumbnails

This is especially significant for small teams and individual businesses without dedicated designers or illustrators, as it serves as an integrated tool for quickly securing design resources.

### 3-4. Figma AI Expands to FigJam, Slides, and Sites

Figma AI isn't limited to **Figma Design**. According to the official documentation, [Figma AI](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/24039793359767-About-Figma-AI) is available across the entire product line, including **Design, FigJam, Figma Slides, Figma Sites, and Figma Make**.

- **FigJam AI** – Automatically diagram ideas or organize and summarize complex feedback
- **Figma Slides** – Expand design results directly into presentation slides
- **Figma Sites** – Publish designs to responsive websites
- **Figma Make** – Create prototypes/apps with real code using prompts

In this way, AI becomes more than just a "design assistant," but rather a **link** connecting the entire process from **planning → design → documentation → presentation → website**.

## 4\. What Figma AI Means for Designers

### 4-1. From "Hand Makers" to "Decision Makers"

In an era where AI determines layouts, suggests text, and generates images, the roles of designers and publishers will inevitably change.

- The ability to **define what to create** is now more important.
- The ability to **determine which of the various AI-generated versions is more appropriate** is required. - The role of **establishing and maintaining standards for "quality" in areas such as brand tone, user experience, and accessibility is strengthened.

Ultimately, people shift from **"hands" to "head and eyes,"** and Figma AI plays a practical role in facilitating this transition.

### 4-2. Practical Benefits from a Developer Perspective

From a front-end developer's perspective, Figma AI can directly assist in the following areas:

- **Quickly Obtain Landing Page Drafts** You can create multiple layout drafts using text prompts, then select the version most easily implemented and incorporate it into publishing.
- **Improved Efficiency of Design-to-Development Handoff** Design information is connected to code and agent tools through Dev Mode, Code Layers, and MCP integration, shifting from "separate design and implementation" to "a single flow."
- **Multilingual/Multi-version UI Management** Thanks to text translation and tone adjustment features, you can quickly create multilingual pages or copy versions for AB testing. - **Reduced Dependence on Image Resources** Simple thumbnails, illustrations, and background images can be created directly within Figma, without having to create them in-house or outsource them.

All of this ultimately means **"more experiments can be done in the same amount of time"**, which in turn leads to **greater strategic value for design and publishing**.

### 4-3. But That Doesn't Mean Designers Are No Longer Needed

Some worry that Figma AI's advancements will eliminate the need for designers. However, various UX research and industry analyses show that current AI design tools are still **assisting rather than replacing professionals**.

While AI-generated drafts are improving, understanding **brand identity, user context, and business goals** and making final decisions based on those insights still **remains the domain of humans**. Figma AI doesn't take away this role; rather, it reduces the surrounding chores so that designers can spend more time on those tasks.

## 5\. The Future Direction of Figma AI and the Design Industry

### 5-1. From a “Design Tool” to an “AI Workspace”

Looking at Figma's roadmap and update flow for 2024-2025, Figma no longer considers itself solely a “design tool.”

- Figma Design – UI/UX design and prototyping
- FigJam – Idea generation and structure
- Figma Slides – Presentations and explanations
- Figma Sites – Responsive website publishing
- Figma Make – Prompt-based app creation
- Figma MCP – Connections with AI agents and coding tools

With AI permeating all these layers, Figma is moving beyond a “design space” to an AI workspace that manages the entire process of “ideas being born, taking shape, and combining with code to bring them to life.”

### 5-2. What Designers and Publishers Need to Prepare

Amidst these changes, designers and web publishers need to prepare for the following two things:

- **A Sense of Using AI as a Tool** It's crucial to gain hands-on experience in how to use prompts to achieve the desired results, and how to accept AI results and where to begin direct intervention.
- **Standards and Language for "Good Design"** As AI produces more and more results, the ability to explain and persuade users of the design that best suits their services and users becomes increasingly important.

Ultimately, Figma AI is likely to become a tool that elevates designers and publishers to **"higher-level roles"**. We are at an inflection point.
