# Agent Era: 5 Most Popular No-Code Tools (Zapier, Make, Lindy, n8n, Stack AI)

It's no exaggeration to say that 2025 will literally be the **Agent Era**. Instead of the "AI that launches a chatbot and answers questions" of the past, **AI agents that make decisions and work across multiple apps** are increasingly becoming the norm.

The problem is that for most people, "agents" still feel like a distant dream. They seem to need coding skills, infrastructure, and API knowledge.

However, the reality is that **the era in which powerful agents can be built with just no-code tools** has already arrived. In this article, we'll select and summarize **the five most talked-about no-code agent tools in real-world and sideline markets and have proven to improve productivity**.

## 1\. The Agent Era and No-Code: Why Should We Consider Them Together?

### 1-1. From “Chatbots” to “Agents”: A Paradigm Shift

The chatbots we commonly use are closer to “conversation-only tools” and cannot move beyond a question-and-answer structure. In contrast, agents can be defined as follows:

- **Understand the situation** (email, calendar, CRM, documents, etc.)
- **Determine the next action** (based on conditions, rules, and goals)
- **Actualize tasks by moving between various tools** (sending emails, creating documents, entering data into databases, etc.)

In other words, agents go beyond “answering AI” to become “working AI.”

### 1-2. Why is No-Code Important?

To effectively utilize agents, three things are essential:

1. A good **Language Model (LLM)** – judgment and natural language understanding
2. A **Workflow Engine** that connects multiple apps
3. **Orchestration** that connects the two

In the past, developers had to manually code all three of these. However, now **no-code automation platforms** like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Make](https://www.make.com/en) have integrated LLM and agent functionality, allowing non-developers to create "agent systems."

Ultimately, it's not far off to say **Agent = LLM + No-code Automation + App Integration**. Therefore, the key question now is no longer "Can I code it?" but **which no-code agent tool should I use?"

## 2. Top 5 Most Popular No-code Agent Tools Today

### 2-1. Zapier Agents – An Agent Hub Connecting 8,000 Apps

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is practically the "original" service for workflow automation. Starting in 2024-2025, it has evolved into a full-fledged **agent orchestration platform** with the addition of **AI Workflows, AI Chatbots, and Zapier Agents**.

[Zapier Agents](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/) in particular is closest to the concept of creating **"AI companions that work across multiple apps"**.

- Number of integrated apps: **8,000+** (Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, HubSpot, etc.)
- Features:
- Design **no-code flow + LLM + tool call** all at once
- Even complex multi-step tasks **can be executed by agents in their own order**
- Direct integration with ChatGPT/Claude for interactive control

However, as of February 2025, there was a security issue (potential token exposure, etc.) in Zapier's internal code repository. Therefore, when using important API keys, it's recommended to adopt security practices such as **regular token rotation and 2FA activation**.

**Recommended for:**

- You already use Zapier for your work.

## 5\. Summary: To keep up with the "Agent Era"

Many research studies predict that the AI ​​agent market will grow from approximately $5.4 billion in 2024 to over $20 billion in 2034. This means the productivity gap between those who know how to work with agents and those who still work manually is widening.

But fortunately, you don't have to be a developer to use agents.

By effectively utilizing the no-code tools introduced today, you can:

- Automate 30-70% of repetitive tasks,
- Free up 1-2 hours a day for creative work,
- Transform your side hustle/projects from feeling like you're working alone to feeling like you're working with a team.

I recommend starting with **One Tool, One Workflow**. If you're already using Zapier, try Zapier Agents. If you prefer a visual workflow, try Make AI Agents. If you're really looking to hire an AI employee, you can start with Lindy.

Agents aren't "implemented" overnight. **They naturally become your coworkers as you build small automations.** The moment you're reading this might be the perfect time to start building that first building block.
