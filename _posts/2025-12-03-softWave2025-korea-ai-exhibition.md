## Reading the 2025 SW & AI Landscape Through Exhibit Categories

### 1. Main Exhibition Categories at a Glance

According to the official guide, the exhibits at SoftWave 2025 are broadly divided into:

- **IT Services**: Cloud, big data, system integration (SI), MSP, operation & maintenance services  
- **Packaged Software**: Security, OS, office/document tools, development tools, storage, backup, and enterprise applications  
- **AI**: Machine learning/deep learning platforms, LLM-based services, MLOps, AI infrastructure, and AI SaaS  
- **Convergence Software**: Telecom/broadcast, healthcare/bio, finance, automotive/mobility, energy, education, semiconductor/manufacturing, robotics/drones, smart city, etc.  
- **Internet & Content Software**: Web/app services, games, content creation tools, ad/marketing platforms, and internet-based services

On the surface this looks like a simple checklist, but it actually reveals how the Korean SW & AI industry is being restructured in 2025.  

In short, it reflects a value chain of:

> **IT infrastructure → AI platforms → industry/domain convergence → user experience–driven content & services**

### 2. IT Services & Packaged SW: The Foundation, Now Reinterpreted with AI

IT services and packaged software have long been at the core of Korea’s SW industry. At SoftWave 2025, it becomes clear that even these “traditional” areas are now undergoing a full AI & cloud transformation:

- Document, email, and groupware tools now come with **GenAI-based summarization, search, and auto authoring**  
- Security, monitoring, and log analytics tools provide **AI-driven anomaly detection and classification**  
- Unified management platforms support **hybrid infrastructures** combining on-prem and public cloud

Previously, AI often existed as an “extra feature” or separate module. Now, we’re entering a stage where it’s almost harder to find software **without** some form of AI deeply embedded in its core design.

### 3. The AI Zone: Shifting Focus from “Technology” to “Use Cases”

The AI section is expected to be one of the busiest areas at SoftWave 2025. But unlike previous years, the story has shifted from “we also do AI” to **“where and how AI is actually being used.”**

Examples include:

- **On-prem and hybrid AI/LLM solutions** for public sector and local governments  
- AI models specialized in **demand forecasting, risk analysis, and quality control** for finance, manufacturing, logistics, and energy  
- Document-centric transformation tools such as **e-document processing, OCR, and RAG-based search & Q&A**  
- **AI-based contact center/chatbot/voicebot** solutions for customer service and civil service channels

In other words, this year’s SoftWave is less about “what AI is” and more about **“how AI is being applied in real operations.”**

### 4. Convergence Software & Smart City: Where You See Industrial Restructuring in Real Time

The convergence SW area bundles together telecom/broadcast, healthcare/bio, finance, automotive, energy, education, semiconductor, engineering, robotics/drones, and smart city.

Here, software is no longer just a “tool” but an **infrastructure that fundamentally changes how industries operate**:

- **Digital twin & smart city platforms** that integrate city-level traffic, energy, and safety data  
- **Healthcare AI** that links and analyzes medical imaging, EMR, and insurance data  
- **Smart factory & predictive maintenance systems** that monitor manufacturing processes and equipment in real time  
- **Integrated control software** to manage robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles

Because these areas are deeply tied to policy, regulation, and infrastructure investment, they directly connect to national competitiveness over the next few years.

### 5. Internet & Content SW: Real-World Tools for Creators and Service Planners

The internet/content SW zone covers games, apps, web services, marketing platforms, and content creation tools — the layer closest to real end-user experience.

With the explosion of generative AI tools in recent years, you’ll find things like:

- **Text generation/summarization/rewrite tools** for blogs, social media, and landing pages  
- Multimodal GenAI services that automatically generate **videos, images, and thumbnails**  
- **Marketing automation platforms** that combine copy, images, and banners based on customer data  
- Engines, editors, and toolchains for **game, metaverse, and interactive content** development

For content creators, publishers, and marketers, this zone is where tools directly translate into **day-to-day productivity gains**, making it worth spending time here.

## Key Themes You Can Read from SoftWave 2025

### 1. The Assumption “Every Software Will Eventually Embed AI” Becoming Reality

By 2025, most commercial software includes some form of AI.  
From documents, email, search, and collaboration to security and operations, AI models and generative features are now integrated deeply into previously “non-AI” domains.

What you’ll notice at SoftWave 2025 is that the competitive edge is no longer **“does it have AI or not,”** but:

> **How seamlessly and reliably AI is woven into real workflows.**

For example, among document-editing tools, the differentiator is whether they can move beyond simple translation/summarization and offer **context-aware suggestions** incorporating policies, regulations, and internal company rules.

### 2. The Rise of On-Prem & Private AI Infrastructure

For sectors handling sensitive data—public, finance, healthcare—there are clear limitations to using public LLM APIs as-is. This has driven strong demand in Korea for **on-prem and private AI infrastructure** running within in-house data centers or private clouds.

At SoftWave 2025, you’ll see offerings such as:

- **AI appliances** that bundle GPU servers, AI frameworks, and model runtime environments  
- **MLOps/LMMOps platforms** that support LLM fine-tuning and RAG pipelines on internal data  
- Enterprise-level AI platforms with **data governance, access control, logging, and auditing**

This signals a structural shift: from being just API consumers to **designing and operating AI infrastructure** domestically.

### 3. SaaS Competition and Digital Transformation for SMBs

The SaaS market for SMEs and mid-sized businesses is another important trend at SoftWave 2025.

Cloud-based subscription services for accounting, tax, HR, groupware, CRM, and project management are spreading rapidly, making “cloud transition” no longer an issue exclusive to large enterprises.

From 2025 onward, **GenAI features are becoming default options within SaaS**, allowing SMBs to access advanced automation and analytics with relatively small budgets.

### 4. Digital Twin & Smart City: Where Policy Meets Market

Smart city and urban data platforms led by national and local governments are long-term, policy-driven projects rather than quick-profit ventures.

By looking at the platforms and solution providers participating in these projects at SoftWave 2025, you can indirectly gauge **which technologies will anchor future policies in urban planning, transportation, energy, and environment.**

### 5. Content Automation: A Threat and an Opportunity for Creators

Multimodal GenAI (text, image, video, audio) is reshaping the entire content production pipeline. A small team can now produce and distribute far more content than before, but as a result, **original perspective, planning, and curation have become even more important.**

By exploring tools in this area at SoftWave 2025, creators and media/marketing professionals can rethink:

> **“What should be automated, and what must remain human-driven?”**

## How to Prepare for an Efficient Visit

### 1. Pre-Event Prep: Connect Online Info with On-Site Experience

Before the event, it’s worth scanning the official website and exhibitor list and narrowing down your focus to 3–5 themes, for example:

- By category: AI infrastructure / SaaS / security / content tools / smart city  
- By industry: public sector / finance / manufacturing / healthcare / education / mobility  
- By role: for developers / planners / operators / creators

This will help you avoid wandering aimlessly and ensure you don’t miss key companies or solutions relevant to your work.

### 2. On-Site Navigation Tips

- On **Day 1**, focus on getting a **high-level map** of the event: walk through each zone and build a mental layout of who is where.  
- On **Day 2**, use your pre-identified list to **deep dive** into selected booths: ask for demos and detailed consultations.  
- The **least crowded times** tend to be right after opening and after 3 PM, which are best for focused discussions.

### 3. Tips for Bloggers & Planners

If you’re visiting with content creation in mind (blog, newsletter, report), it helps to track:

- The **keywords and slogans** each company emphasizes  
- Repeated phrases you see on booths (e.g., “Korea’s first,” “on-prem LLM,” “hybrid AI”)  
- Concrete assets like demo screens, architecture diagrams, and pricing charts  
- The **target customers** and **key use cases** explained by booth staff

These notes will make it much easier to produce deeper content such as:
