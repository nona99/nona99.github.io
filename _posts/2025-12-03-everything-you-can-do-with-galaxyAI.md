## 1. Using Galaxy AI in Your Morning Routine

### 1) Summarizing News and Long Articles

One of the most practical features in Galaxy AI is **text summarization**.  
Whenever you select a long piece of text – news articles, blog posts, PDF documents, even long KakaoTalk messages – Galaxy AI can condense it into a concise summary focused on key points. This is especially helpful when you want to absorb information quickly in the morning.

Typical benefits:

- Faster understanding of work documents, announcements, and internal notices  
- Ability to skim long news or industry reports by reading only the core points  
- Easy grasp of the overall flow when chat conversations get too long  

Usage is simple: just select the text and tap **“Summarize.”**

### 2) Camera Translation

If you often consume AI-related or tech content, you’ll frequently encounter foreign articles and documents.  
With Galaxy AI, you can simply point your camera at the text and see an **instant overlay translation** on the screen.

This is incredibly convenient when reading:

- UI screens  
- Technical documentation  
- English-language announcements or manuals  

You don’t need to switch to a separate translation app – you see the translated result immediately.  
Camera translation is also very useful in real life when traveling abroad, reading menus, signs, and instructions.

## 2. Preparing for Work with Galaxy AI

### 1) Polishing Writing and Changing Tone

Galaxy AI can refine selected sentences and adjust the tone to match different situations.  
It offers various tone options such as:

- More polite  
- Simpler  
- Smoother  
- Social media style, etc.

This is especially helpful when:

- Responding to clients  
- Writing official notices or announcements  
- Drafting emails where tone matters  

You can also use it to polish blog post drafts, making your writing more natural and easier to read.

### 2) Document Scanning and Auto Enhancement

Galaxy smartphones already have solid **document scanning** features, but with Galaxy AI, the quality of:

- Perspective correction  
- Shadow removal  
- Sharpness enhancement  

has become even more refined.

You can neatly capture and store:

- Meeting documents  
- Business cards  
- Contracts and forms  

This makes your document management much more efficient in day-to-day work.

## 3. Practical Use During Meetings and Work

### 1) Recording Meetings → Automatic Summaries

When you record a meeting, Galaxy AI can automatically create a **summary of the key content**.  
It organizes:

- Main discussion points  
- Conclusions  
- Action items (To-dos)

This drastically reduces the time you need to spend writing meeting minutes.

It also makes it much easier to extract requirements for real projects, and if you’re creating interview-based blog content, you can follow a:

> record → transcribe → summarize  

workflow very comfortably.

### 2) Real-Time Speech-to-Text

During a meeting, you can convert key sentences, technical terms, and numeric data into text in real time.  
This lets you:

- Capture important details more accurately  
- Draft meeting notes faster  
- Quickly log requirements or ideas  

It’s a powerful tool for staying on top of fast-paced discussions.

### 3) Call and Face-to-Face Interpretation

When you need to communicate with overseas partners or clients, the **interpretation** features can help you continue the conversation without stress.

- Real-time translation during calls  
- Face-to-face interpretation mode for in-person meetings, travel, or consultations  

It’s intuitive and particularly useful in cross-border communication scenarios.

## 4. Optimizing Research and Investigation Tasks

### 1) Circle to Search

One of the flagship Galaxy AI features, **Circle to Search**, lets you simply draw a circle around any element on your screen to search for it.  

Since you no longer need to type keywords into a search bar, your **research speed increases dramatically**.

Typical use cases:

- Searching for reference images for UI/UX design  
- Looking up technical terms or patterns  
- Quickly finding information on cafés, products, or locations  

Planners and designers are among the users who benefit the most from this feature.

### 2) Translating Documents and PDFs

When you need to read:

- Technical documentation  
- Foreign white papers  
- API guides or developer docs  

Galaxy AI’s translation capabilities can save a lot of time.

IT-related documents often have:

- Long sentence structures  
- Many domain-specific terms  

So high-quality, context-aware translation can significantly speed up your workflow.

### 1) AI Photo Editing

Galaxy AI offers advanced yet easy-to-use photo editing features such as:

- Automatic adjustment of composition  

If you run a blog and want to improve the quality of your images – especially:

- Food photos  
- Travel photos  
- Product review shots  

– this can be extremely useful.

It’s not at the level of a full-blown studio retouch, but it is **highly optimized for “quick and clean” editing on mobile.**

### 2) Video Stabilization and Slow-Motion Enhancement

AI-based video stabilization smooths out shaky clips, and frame interpolation can turn normal videos into **natural slow-motion** footage.

For YouTube Shorts, Reels, and other social media video content, this can make a big difference in perceived quality.

### 3) Automating Draft Writing on Mobile

Using **Galaxy Keyboard AI**, you can comfortably draft blog posts on your phone.

Features like:

- Sentence expansion  
- Summarization  
- Natural phrasing and correction  

let you create content drafts quickly, even while commuting or on the go.

- Menus  
- Signs  
- Posters or information boards  

You can take a photo or simply point the camera at the text to see the translation right away, without switching between apps.

### 2) Easier Shopping and Product Search

Thanks to Circle to Search, you can:

- See an item on social media or in a video  
- Circle it on your screen  
- Immediately search for the same or similar products  

This makes the shopping experience itself much simpler and more fluid.

## 8. Final Thoughts: Galaxy AI as “AI You Actually Feel in Daily Life”

Galaxy AI is composed of features that you can **immediately feel in real-life usage**, without complex setup:

- Text organization  
- Translation  
- Photo editing  
- Video enhancement  
- Meeting recording and summarization  

These are all tasks most people face at least once a day, and Galaxy AI helps you handle them **more lightly and more intelligently.**

If you use these features consistently, you’ll likely reach a point where going back to the old way of doing things feels cumbersome by comparison.
