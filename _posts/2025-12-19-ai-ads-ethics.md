AI-made images and ads are everywhere now. That’s not automatically a problem.  
The real problem starts when people **mistake AI content for real evidence**, or when the content **harms someone’s rights, privacy, or reputation**.

This guide isn’t about “AI is good” vs “AI is bad.” It’s a practical, global checklist built around what many countries and major platforms increasingly share: **transparency + harm reduction**.

---

## 1) Two types of AI visuals — and why the difference matters

- **AI-generated**: created from scratch (the image/video/audio didn’t exist before)  
- **AI-edited**: started with a real source, then AI changed meaning (face, voice, scene, claim, context)

The highest-risk situations are when the final output **looks like reality** (news footage, proof, endorsements) even if it’s “just an edit.”

---

## 2) The global common denominator: transparency + minimizing harm

Laws vary by country, but international frameworks repeat the same core ideas:

1) **Don’t mislead people**  
2) **Don’t cause avoidable harm** (privacy, defamation, discrimination, fraud)  
3) **Make it explainable** (so others can understand what it is and how it was made)

If you want the “global backbone” references:

- **OECD AI Principles** (Transparency / responsible disclosure): [oecd.ai/en/ai-principles](https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles)  
- **UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI** (human rights, accountability, auditability): [unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380455](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380455)  
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (trustworthy AI properties): [nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)

## 3) When disclosure is basically non-negotiable

Disclosure is most important when the content could be **mistaken as real** or **influences decisions**.

### High-risk cases where disclosure should be strong and obvious
- **Realistic faces or voices** that look/sound like a real person (celebrity or not)
- **“News-like” visuals** (events, disasters, conflict, protests) that look like documentary evidence
- **Before/after claims** (health, skincare, body, treatments) that can mislead consumers
- **Fake endorsements** (“this doctor recommends…”, “this celebrity uses…”, “this person said…”)  
- **Politics and public issues**, where synthetic media can distort trust quickly

### Major regulators and platforms are moving in the same direction
- EU transparency direction (Article 50 context): [ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-50](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-50)  
- YouTube disclosure for altered/synthetic content: [support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491)  
- TikTok labeling for AI-generated content: [newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-labels-for-disclosing-ai-generated-content](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-labels-for-disclosing-ai-generated-content)  
- Meta approach to labeling manipulated/AI media: [about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/)

**Rule of thumb:**  
If a reasonable person could say **“Wait… is this real?”**, your disclosure isn’t optional anymore—it’s a safety feature.

## 4) Ads and sponsorships: separate from “AI disclosure,” always important

Even if an image is 100% real, if the content is **paid** or includes **affiliate incentives**, audiences should be able to tell it’s marketing.

- US FTC guidance (endorsements / “material connections”): [ftc.gov/.../ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking)  
- UK ASA/CAP guidance (recognising marketing communications): [asa.org.uk/.../recognising-marketing-communications-overview.html](https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/recognising-marketing-communications-overview.html)

**Plain English version:** If money, freebies, or commissions are involved, say so clearly—early, not hidden.

---

## 5) Where ethics controversies explode: likeness, privacy, and copyright

### A) Likeness and voice (real people)
The moment an AI image makes someone look like they **did** or **endorsed** something, you can create:
- deception risk
- reputational harm
- consent and rights issues (vary by jurisdiction, but the principle is consistent)

**Practical safe line:**  
If you don’t have permission, don’t make it look like a real person is in your ad.

### B) Privacy
AI visuals can accidentally expose:
- identifiable faces
- license plates, addresses, school/company IDs
- children’s information
- “sensitive context” (medical, location, personal circumstances)

Even if you didn’t intend harm, **identifiability** is enough to create risk.

### C) Copyright and “AI made it, so it’s mine”
This is still evolving globally. Helpful starting points:

- US Copyright Office AI hub: [copyright.gov/ai](https://www.copyright.gov/ai/)  
- WIPO AI & IP overview: [wipo.int/.../artificial-intelligence](https://www.wipo.int/en/web/frontier-technologies/artificial-intelligence/index)

**Practical safe line:**  
Avoid outputs that closely imitate a recognizable brand style, character, or specific artwork—especially in commercial contexts.

---

## 6) The “nutrition label” approach: Content Credentials (C2PA)

Beyond plain-text disclosure, there’s a growing push to attach **provenance metadata**—signals about how content was made and edited.

A major standard here is **C2PA**:

- C2PA Explainer: [c2pa.org/.../explainer/Explainer.html](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/explainer/Explainer.html)  
- C2PA Specifications index: [c2pa.org/.../2.2/index.html](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/index.html)

This isn’t a perfect “truth machine,” but it’s part of a broader movement: making it harder to hide manipulation at scale.

---

## 7) The 30-second checklist (for anyone seeing AI ads or images)

1) Does it look like **real evidence** (news footage, “proof,” a documented event)?   
2) Does it show a **real person** or a person who looks real?   
3) Is it asking you to **buy**, **donate**, **vote**, or **panic** quickly?   
4) Are there obvious “too perfect” signs (hands, teeth, text, reflections, lighting)?   
5) Is there **clear disclosure** that it’s synthetic/edited?   
6) Is it an ad—does it clearly say **ad/sponsored/affiliate**?   
7) Is there a trustworthy **source link** (official statement, reputable reporting, research)?   
8) Are other reliable sources confirming it—or only one viral post?   
9) Does it make extreme claims (“100% guaranteed,” “shocking truth,” “instant results”)?   
10) If you’re unsure: **pause before sharing**. The fastest way misinformation spreads is urgency. 

---

## 8) Simple disclosure text examples (short, clear, human)

Use language that removes confusion in one glance:

- **AI-generated/edited disclosure:**  
  “This image was generated or edited using AI.”

- **Realism warning (when it could be mistaken as real):**  
  “This is synthetic media (AI-made). It is not real footage.”

- **Ad/affiliate disclosure:**  
  “Sponsored” / “Paid partnership” / “This post contains affiliate links; I may earn a commission.”

### Quick note
This is general information, not legal advice. If you’re in a regulated industry (health, finance, politics) or using real people’s likeness/voice, it’s worth getting proper legal review.  
But for everyday use, the global “minimum standard” is simple:

**Disclose what could mislead. Protect rights and privacy. Verify before you amplify.**
