Over the past year, I’ve reviewed and worked with AI-generated images and ads across real projects — from marketing visuals to editorial content.  
This article reflects the patterns I kept seeing: where people get confused, where platforms push back, and where creators get themselves into serious trouble.

AI-made images and ads are everywhere now. That’s not automatically a problem.  
The real problem starts when people **mistake AI content for real evidence**, or when the content **harms someone’s rights, privacy, or reputation**.

This guide isn’t about “AI is good” vs “AI is bad.” It’s a practical, global checklist built around what many countries and major platforms increasingly share: **transparency + harm reduction**.

---

## 1) Two types of AI visuals — and why the difference matters

- **AI-generated**: created from scratch (the image/video/audio didn’t exist before)  
- **AI-edited**: started with a real source, then AI changed meaning (face, voice, scene, claim, context)

The highest-risk situations are when the final output **looks like reality** (news footage, proof, endorsements) even if it’s “just an edit.”

In practice, most serious disputes I’ve seen start right here — not with the technology itself, but with how easily audiences misinterpret what they’re looking at.

---

## 2) The global common denominator: transparency + minimizing harm

Laws vary by country, but international frameworks repeat the same core ideas:

1) **Don’t mislead people**  
2) **Don’t cause avoidable harm** (privacy, defamation, discrimination, fraud)  
3) **Make it explainable** (so others can understand what it is and how it was made)

If you want the “global backbone” references:

- **OECD AI Principles** (Transparency / responsible disclosure): https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles  
- **UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI** (human rights, accountability, auditability): https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380455  
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (trustworthy AI properties): https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework

## 3) When disclosure is basically non-negotiable

Disclosure is most important when the content could be **mistaken as real** or **influences decisions**.

### High-risk cases where disclosure should be strong and obvious
- **Realistic faces or voices** that look/sound like a real person (celebrity or not)
- **“News-like” visuals** (events, disasters, conflict, protests) that look like documentary evidence
- **Before/after claims** (health, skincare, body, treatments) that can mislead consumers
- **Fake endorsements** (“this doctor recommends…”, “this celebrity uses…”, “this person said…”)  
- **Politics and public issues**, where synthetic media can distort trust quickly

### Major regulators and platforms are moving in the same direction
- EU transparency direction: https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-50  
- YouTube disclosure: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491  
- TikTok labeling: https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-labels-for-disclosing-ai-generated-content  
- Meta approach: https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/

**Rule of thumb:**  
If a reasonable person could say **“Wait… is this real?”**, your disclosure isn’t optional anymore — it’s a safety feature.

## 4) Ads and sponsorships: separate from “AI disclosure,” always important

Even if an image is 100% real, if the content is **paid** or includes **affiliate incentives**, audiences should be able to tell it’s marketing.

- US FTC guidance: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking  
- UK ASA/CAP guidance: https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/recognising-marketing-communications-overview.html

**Plain English version:**  
If money, freebies, or commissions are involved, say so clearly — early, not hidden.

---

## 5) Where ethics controversies explode: likeness, privacy, and copyright

### A) Likeness and voice (real people)
The moment an AI image makes someone look like they **did** or **endorsed** something, you create:
- deception risk
- reputational harm
- consent and rights issues

**Practical safe line:**  
If you don’t have permission, don’t make it look like a real person is in your ad.

### B) Privacy
AI visuals can accidentally expose:
- identifiable faces
- license plates, addresses, school/company IDs
- children’s information
- sensitive personal context

Even if you didn’t intend harm, **identifiability alone creates risk**.

### C) Copyright and “AI made it, so it’s mine”
Helpful starting points:

- US Copyright Office AI hub: https://www.copyright.gov/ai/  
- WIPO AI & IP overview: https://www.wipo.int/en/web/frontier-technologies/artificial-intelligence/index

**Practical safe line:**  
Avoid outputs that closely imitate a recognizable brand style, character, or specific artwork — especially in commercial contexts.

## 6) The “nutrition label” approach: Content Credentials (C2PA)

Beyond plain-text disclosure, there’s a growing push to attach **provenance metadata** — signals about how content was made and edited.

A major standard here is **C2PA**:

- C2PA Explainer: https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/explainer/Explainer.html  
- C2PA Specs: https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/index.html

This isn’t a perfect “truth machine,” but it’s part of a broader movement: making manipulation harder to hide at scale.

---

## 7) The 30-second checklist (for anyone seeing AI ads or images)

1) Does it look like **real evidence**?  
2) Does it show a **real person** or someone who looks real?  
3) Is it asking you to **buy, donate, vote, or panic** quickly?  
4) Are there obvious “too perfect” signs (hands, teeth, text, reflections, lighting)?  
5) Is there **clear disclosure** it’s synthetic or edited?  
6) Is it an ad — does it clearly say **ad/sponsored/affiliate**?  
7) Is there a trustworthy **source link**?  
8) Are other reliable sources confirming it?  
9) Does it make extreme claims?  
10) If unsure: **pause before sharing**.

---

## 8) Simple disclosure text examples

- **AI disclosure:**  
  “This image was generated or edited using AI.”

- **Realism warning:**  
  “This is synthetic media (AI-made). It is not real footage.”

- **Ad disclosure:**  
  “Sponsored” / “Paid partnership” / “This post contains affiliate links; I may earn a commission.”

### Final note

This is general information, not legal advice.  
But the global minimum standard is simple:

**Disclose what could mislead. Protect rights and privacy. Verify before you amplify.**
