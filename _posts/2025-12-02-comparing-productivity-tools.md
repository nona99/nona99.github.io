As the number of people working alone—freelancers, solopreneurs, and solo creators—increases, the question of "What productivity tools should I use?" grows. Especially when people are using multiple tools, such as calendars, task management, projects, documents, and notes, managing the tools can often lead to more time being wasted.

Therefore, interest in all-in-one productivity tools, which bundle multiple functions into one, has grown. Today, for those who work alone without a team, we'll compare four popular all-in-one productivity tools from a practical perspective.

## Why are all-in-one tools even more important when working alone?

The biggest problem when working alone is "work becoming scattered." Email, messengers, calendars, to-do apps, note apps, Excel, documents... The more tools you have, the more cluttered your mind becomes, making it harder to see "what to do right now."

The essence of an all-in-one productivity tool is the ability to organize tasks, information, and time on a single screen. For example, [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) is designed to handle documents, databases, project management, and wikis within a single workspace, while [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) aims to be a work operating system (Work OS) that brings together "almost everything related to work"—from projects, documents, chats, and dashboards—in one place.

Additionally, [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) acts as an **AI calendar/planner** that automatically organizes schedules and tasks using AI. [Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/) is a digital daily planner focused on "planning the day," integrating your calendar and tasks on a single screen to help you "design a calm day."

In short, the more you work alone, the more important an all-in-one tool becomes. **Productivity is determined by the power of "consolidating work," not "splitting it."**

## Four Leading All-in-One Tools at a Glance

The following four tools are often cited as all-in-one productivity tools because they can "replace multiple apps."

| Tools | Core Position | Feels like you're using it alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notion | Notes + Database + Project Management + Wiki | "Feels like my entire head is digitized" |
| ClickUp | Work OS focused on project and task management | "A tool that truly shines with more projects" |
| Motion | AI Calendar + Automatic Scheduling | "An app that lets an AI assistant plan your day" |
| Sunsama | Daily Planner + Task and Calendar Integration | "A tool for managing your work calmly and without burnout" |

### 1\. Notion – An all-in-one notebook/DB that lets you create your own workspace

[Notion](https://www.notion.com/) is a **block-based workspace** that supports note-taking, wikis, databases, and project boards. Within a single page, you can stack paragraphs, checklists, tables, Kanban boards, and more like blocks to create your own custom layout.

Individual users can use virtually unlimited pages and blocks even with the free plan, and for more advanced features and collaboration, you can upgrade to a paid plan (Plus, Business, etc.). Recently, Notion has even integrated AI features like summarization, writing assistance, and idea brainstorming through **Notion AI**, promoting itself as an "AI workspace."

For solo users, Notion's greatest strength is its ability to **"design your own system."** You can hierarchically organize all aspects of your work and life, including project management, content calendars, reading logs, revenue/expense management, and client management, all within a single workspace.

However, this freedom can sometimes create a **barrier to entry**. Trying to build from scratch without a template can be overwhelming, and often leads to restructuring the page structure repeatedly. This is why people often say, "I spent all my time customizing the tool."

### 2. ClickUp – A Powerful Work OS for Freelancers with Multiple Projects

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) was built from the ground up as a **"work OS for managing everything in one place"**. It integrates most work-related elements, including project and task management, documents, chat, whiteboards, time tracking, and dashboards, into a single platform.

Originally used by startups and teams, ClickUp is increasingly being used by **freelancers and consultants with numerous clients** as a "personal project hub." This is because it allows you to manage your pipeline by dividing each client's space/project into its own, and assigning due dates, priorities, and custom fields to tasks.

ClickUp's strength lies in its **various and customizable views**. You can view and manage the same data in a variety of ways, including lists, boards, gargantt charts, calendars, and box views. Once you've established a structure, management becomes significantly easier.

However, there's a clear downside. Because of its extensive functionality, the interface can feel overwhelming for casual users. Rather than focusing on a simple checklist app, it's more appropriate for situations where clients, projects, and deadlines are all piling up simultaneously.

### 3\. Motion – A Productivity Superapp That Uses AI to Automatically Plan Your Daily Schedule

[Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) is a rapidly rising **AI-powered all-in-one productivity platform**. Its core concept is to integrate work-related elements like AI calendars, tasks, projects, meetings, notes, and documents into a single app, with AI automatically structuring your schedule.

Motion's most notable feature is **"AI Scheduling"**. When you register your to-do list, write down the due date, estimated time, and priority. Motion analyzes your calendar and automatically arranges tasks accordingly. As deadlines approach or work piles up, the AI ​​rearranges tasks and suggests new schedules.

For those who work alone, Motion feels like having a "boss and secretary." It reduces the time spent wondering, "What should I do now?" and lets you see your priorities for the day simply by opening your calendar.

The downsides are the price and language barrier. The monthly subscription fee is higher than other simple to-do apps, and the interface and instructions are primarily English, so it can take some getting used to if you're not fluent in English. Furthermore, if you're uncomfortable with "AI automatically adjusting your schedule," it might feel a bit overwhelming.

### 4\. Sunsama – A Daily Planner That Helps You Work Calmly and Without Burnout

[Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/) is a digital daily planner that helps you calmly plan your day by integrating your to-do list and calendar into one screen.

Unlike other tools, it focuses on daily routines and focused time. Its signature feature is "guided planning," which allows you to choose which tasks to bring forward each morning and allocate actual time to each task.

Studies show that spending just 10-12 minutes planning each day can significantly improve productivity. Sunsama embeds this "planning" process into the app itself. This makes it particularly well-suited for freelancers and knowledge workers who have a lot to do but are concerned about burnout.

The downside is the price and the Korean language support. As a premium tool, the subscription fee is quite high, and the English-based interface can be a bit unfamiliar at first. However, for those who prioritize "routine over functionality," this tool will increase your satisfaction with continued use.

## Which tool is right for me? Recommendations based on situation

### 1. Solo freelancers trying an all-in-one tool for the first time

**Recommended combination: Notion alone or Notion + a simple to-do app**

If you're new to Notion, it's a good idea to start with [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), which allows you to centrally manage your work logs, ideas, client information, portfolios, blog posts, and more. Notion's free plan is sufficient for personal use, and those with a flair for design can find page structure quite enjoyable.

However, its "What should I do today?" feature is relatively weak, so I recommend starting with a basic smartphone to-do app or a simple to-do app (e.g., Google Tasks) and gradually building your own system.

### 2. Solo entrepreneurs/freelancers with numerous clients and projects and tight deadlines

**Recommended combination: ClickUp alone or ClickUp + Notion**

If you have multiple clients and are constantly working on five or more projects, [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) can feel much more powerful. If you want to break down tasks into individual projects, manage statuses (e.g., requested, in progress, reviewed, completed) on a Kanban board, and even view calendars and gargantt views based on due dates, ClickUp offers a more PM-like experience than Notion.

A popular combination is to use Notion for organizing documents, wikis, and references, while ClickUp manages actual tasks and deadlines. Linking or linking the two allows for a clear division of tasks, with ClickUp being the project board and Notion for in-depth document organization.

### 3\. For those who worry more about "when" than "what to do"

**Recommended combination: Motion alone or Motion + Notion/ClickUp**

If you've already organized your to-dos but are concerned about **how to fit them into your daily schedule**, [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) can make a huge difference. Motion automatically creates and inserts calendar blocks when you enter tasks, reducing the time spent wondering "when to do them?"

If you already have tasks organized well in Notion or ClickUp, you can create a workflow that imports those tasks into Motion and converts them into actual calendar entries. This separates the "information center" from the "actual schedule," making each role more distinct.

### 4. People concerned about burnout and a calm daily routine is important.

**Recommended combination: Sunsama alone or Sunsama + Notion**

If you already have your schedule and to-dos piled up in multiple apps, but feel overwhelmed when you start your day, [Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/) might be a better fit. Sunsama is designed to help you calmly organize your daily tasks every morning, thinking about "what to do today and how much time to spend on each task."

If you have all your projects and information stored in Notion, it's a natural combination to import only today's tasks into Sunsama to create a "realistic to-do list for today."

## Practical Example: Daily Workflow of a Solo Freelancer

### Example 1) Notion + Motion Combination

First thing in the morning, I open **Notion** and review the tasks and projects I have to do this week. If I have any new ideas or requests, I add them to my Notion database.

Next, open **Motion** and check your calendar for today. Transfer or sync tasks from Notion to Motion, and enter deadlines and estimated times under "Things I want to finish today." Motion will then automatically schedule tasks for you during times when you can focus and avoid meetings and commitments.

The advantage of this structure is that Notion acts as a "home for long-term information and records," while Motion acts as the "engine that actually drives today."

### Example 2) Managing projects from start to finish with ClickUp

Freelancers with multiple clients can create separate ClickUp spaces or projects for each client. This allows you to manage requests, ongoing work, feedback, revisions, and completion stages on a Kanban board or list, assigning due dates and priorities to each task.

Opening the calendar view allows you to see at a glance which clients you're spending the most time on this week and which deadlines are pending. ClickUp's advantages become more pronounced the more projects you have.

You can collect documents in ClickUp Docs, or organize design guides and reference documents in Notion, and simply link to the relevant pages in your tasks.

### Example 3) Designing a "Burnout-Preventing" Day Centered on Sunsama

Every morning, the first thing I do is open **Sunsama**. From the to-dos scattered across my email, calendar, and task apps, I select only those that absolutely need to be done today and drag them to Sunsama's "Today" section.

I write down the estimated time for each task and check the total work time for the day. This process already gives me the sense that "I can't do more than this today," so I naturally adjust my priorities based on how much I can accomplish that day.

By repeating this "selection and focus" process every day, you'll find that while the workload remains the same, the perceived stress level is significantly reduced.

## When Starting Out, Choosing This Way Will Make You Less Lost

The most common mistake people make when choosing tools is "looking for the perfect tool." In reality, there's no such thing as a perfect tool; there's only "the tool that's right for my current situation."

Simply consider the following:

1. Do I need to prioritize information organization, or do I need to prioritize schedule and time management?
2. Is project management complex due to the large number of clients and projects?
3. How much of an English interface or monthly subscription fee can I afford?

If you prioritize information organization, consider Notion. If project management and deadlines are more important, consider ClickUp. If time and schedule management are your top priorities, consider Motion or Sunsama.

Rather than trying to set everything up perfectly from the start, it's much more important to "experience using a tool in your daily life" for two weeks to a month. This is because actual experience allows you to clearly see what you find inconvenient and what features you want more of.

## Summary: "My unique way of working" is more important than the tools themselves.

The four all-in-one tools introduced today ([Notion](https://www.notion.com/), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/), and [Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/)) each have distinct strengths and unique characteristics.

However, ultimately, what matters is not which tool you use, but whether you can build your own system based on that tool. Tools are merely a foundation for better work; the right answer always lies within your own work style, energy patterns, and preferences.

If even one tool came to mind while reading this, I encourage you to download the free plan today and experiment lightly with the mindset of "let's run my day within this tool." As you use it, you'll begin to clearly see your own unique patterns, thinking, "Ah, this is how I work."
