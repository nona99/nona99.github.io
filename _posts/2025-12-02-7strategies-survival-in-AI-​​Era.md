# 7 Strategies for Individual Survival in the AI ​​Era: A New Way of Working We Must Change

AI is rapidly changing the very structure of work, moving beyond mere "tools."

With the addition of generative AI, agent AI, and on-device AI, the gap between "those who know how to use AI" and "those who can elevate their work with AI" is widening.

This article focuses on **what individuals need to change to survive and not be left behind in the AI ​​era**, rather than grand theories.

We will briefly review technological trends and outline **7 practical survival strategies** that individuals can adopt within them.

---

## 1. How is "work" being reshaped in the AI ​​era?

To survive in the AI ​​era, we must first clearly understand "what's changing." Rather than vague anxiety, understanding the structure will clarify our response strategy.

### 1-1. It's not "automation," but "role restructuring."

Many people worry only about "will AI take my job?" but in reality, more subtle changes are occurring in the field.

- Simple, repetitive tasks → **automation/semi-automation**
- Information collection and organization → AI creates drafts first, while humans focus on **verification and decision-making**
- Content creation → AI creates drafts, while humans focus on **planning, tone adjustment, and branding**
- Development and technical roles → AI generates code drafts, while humans focus on **architecture, quality, review, and integration**

Typical examples include AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), Claude, and [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), which are already replacing tasks like document writing, summarizing, translation, code generation, and drafting plans.

In other words, AI is encroaching on the mechanical aspects of the "front and back ends of work,"

leaving humans increasingly in roles closer to **judgment, context, responsibility, and design**.

### 1-2. “People who use AI vs. People who create AI vs. People who design with AI”

Individuals in the AI ​​era are roughly divided into three groups.

1. **People who simply use AI as a tool**
- Only occasionally inputting prompts
- Productivity increases slightly, but the potential for replacement remains high
2. **People who integrate AI into their workflows**
- Redesign repetitive tasks with AI and utilize them on a team/project basis
- Recognized as “that person knows how to restructure work itself using AI”
3. **People who design systems with AI**
- Integrate AI into workflows, processes, products, and services
- Differentiation at higher levels, such as planners, project managers, leaders, and senior developers/designers

Surviving in the AI ​​era isn't simply about "having used AI once," but rather, "Can I restructure my work around AI?"

## 2\. Survival Strategy ①: Making "AI Literacy" a Basic Knowledge

### 2-1. Minimum Required Knowledge

The concepts that constitute "basic knowledge" in the AI ​​era are now as follows:

- **Generative AI**: AI that generates text, images, code, and speech
- **Large-Scale Language Model (LLM)**: Models that understand and generate natural language, such as ChatGPT and Gemini
- **Agent AI**: AI that goes beyond simple responses and continuously performs multiple tasks
- **On-device AI**: AI that runs directly on the device, such as [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) and [Galaxy AI](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/ai/)
- **Multimodal AI**: AI that simultaneously handles multiple types of data, such as text, images, voice, and video

Understanding these terms to a level of accuracy is the first step.

This is because most future products, services, and work tools will be designed around these concepts.

### 2-2. A Practical Routine to Develop AI Literacy

AI literacy isn't achieved through theoretical study alone; **"hands-on" experience is key**.

For example, I recommend this routine:

- 10 minutes a day on [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
- Summarize today's work
- Organize tomorrow's tasks
- Draft emails and messengers
- Organize what you've learned/create quizzes
- Read one or two short AI-related articles per week
- Examples: OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Apple newsrooms, major tech blogs
- Once a month
- Create a list of tasks you're currently working on that could be handed over to AI.

Even if this becomes a habit,

you can go from "someone who doesn't know what AI is" to "someone who uses AI naturally."

## 3\. Survival Strategy ②: Separating What to Hand Over to AI and What to Keep

### 3-1. What AI Does Well vs. What People Do Well

Whether you view AI as something to fear or leverage depends on how you **separate roles**.

**What AI Does Well**

- Summarizing, transforming, and rewriting large amounts of text
- Creating template-based document and email drafts
- Exploring code patterns and suggesting refactorings
- Keyword brainstorming, generating idea lists
- Repetitive formatting tasks (table conversion, unit conversion, formatting, etc.)

**What People Do Well**

- **Problem definition**: deciding what to build and why
- Coordinating stakeholders, understanding organizational politics and context
- Making decisions involving brand tone, ethics, policies, and accountability
- Determining "Is this the right direction?" in ambiguous situations

### 3-2. Deconstructing Your Work from an AI Perspective

If you want to survive in the AI ​​era, it's important to practice breaking down your work into the following categories:

1. Break down your work into as many detailed steps as possible.
2. Next to each step, write down whether it would be best to delegate the task to "AI," "human," or "AI+human."
3. Experiment with steps that can be handed over to AI using tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

For example, if you're a planner:

- Market research → AI collects and summarizes primary data, human verifies and interprets
- Competitive service analysis → AI summarizes features and reviews, human derives strategic insights
- Proposal writing → AI drafts, human refines structure, story, and message

By breaking it down like this, your perspective shifts from "AI is taking my work" to "It's clear what I have to give to AI and what I have to take."

## 4\. Survival Strategy ③: Designing a "Workflow," Not a "Prompt"

### 4-1. "How to Use Prompts Well" Is No Longer Enough

While "how to use prompts well" was initially the key,
now, the next step, "Where and how to integrate AI" is becoming more important.

- Those who stop at "How do I ask this question?" vs.
- Those who move on to "How do I restructure this entire work process around AI?"

Going forward, the bigger gap will come from the **second type of person**.

### 4-2. Basic Patterns of Workflow Design

Designing an AI workflow that individuals can use is surprisingly simple. Just remember the following four steps:

1. **Organize Input**
- Clearly outline the current data, requirements, and constraints.
- Example: "Summarize these emails and create briefing notes for meetings."
2. **Define tasks to be assigned to AI**
- Summarize, transform, structure, catalog, code generation, format unification, etc.
3. **Designate areas for human review and editing**
- Define areas of the AI ​​results that must be checked by humans in advance.
- Example: Numbers, dates, conditions, legal text, etc.
4. **Find areas that can be repeated and automated**
- If the task is repeated weekly or daily, fix it at the template, prompt, or macro level.

Based on this structure, you can use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/),
or [Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai), Slack AI, or [GitHub](https://www.notion.so/product/ai). By incorporating tools like Copilot (https://github.com/features/copilot), you can move from being a "prompt expert" to an "AI workflow designer."

## 5. Survival Strategy 4: Redesigning Your Self-Profile with "AI-Friendly Competencies"

### 5-1. Competencies That Will Become More Valuable in the AI ​​Era

As AI advances, the market value of the following competencies will actually increase.

- **Domain Expertise**
- Finance, healthcare, law, manufacturing, education, content, UX, etc.
- AI cannot understand every industry. The combination of a person who understands the industry and AI is powerful.
- **Problem Definition Ability**
- The ability to clearly articulate in words "what problem we really need to solve"
- The ability to write prompts is ultimately a derivative of problem definition ability.
- **Communication/Storytelling**
- The ability to connect information and restructure it into a persuasive message
- The role of translating AI-generated drafts into human language will continue to be important.
- **Data/Digital Literacy**
- Basic data reading, simple analysis, and tool understanding skills
- The ability to ask questions about data, even if you're not a professional data scientist.

### 5-2. Update your resume and portfolio to the "AI era"

If you want to survive in the AI ​​era, we recommend adding the following elements to your resume and portfolio:

- "Which tasks have you automated/semi-automated using AI?"
- "How much productivity has been increased using which tools (quantifiable figures are preferable)"
- "Experience creating new types of output using AI (e.g., interactive reports, designing AI-assisted features, etc.)"

Now, the key selling point is not "I know how to use AI," but "How I have changed the outcome using AI."

## 6\. Survival Strategy ⑤: Developing the Habit of Using AI Tools as Your "Daily OS"

### 6-1. Integrating AI into Your Daily Routine

If you treat AI as a "tool to be used only on special occasions," its utilization will remain infinitely low.

Conversely, if you develop the habit of **leaving even the smallest tasks to AI**, you can level up faster than you think.

For example:

- Morning
- Hand over today's to-do list to AI and ask it to reorganize by importance and time.
- During work
- Use AI constantly for email drafts, meeting agendas, meeting minutes, document structure, code refactoring, etc.
- Evening
- Summarize what you learned today and prepare for tomorrow (list questions, organize areas for improvement). Ask AI to help you organize it.

This process can be done with tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), and [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

If you consistently repeat this process with a tool that suits you well, it will gradually become something close to your "personal OS."

### 6-2. Actively utilize on-device AI

On-device AI, such as [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) and [Galaxy AI](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/ai/), which run directly on the device, offers powerful features in terms of **privacy, speed, and convenience**.

- Instant text extraction and summarization from photos
- Real-time captioning/summarizing of call and meeting content
- Cross-app automation (e.g., a personal assistant linking calendar, notes, and email)
- System-level translation, summarization, and sentence polishing

The productivity gap will widen significantly depending on whether these features are simply "novel features" or integrated into **work and daily routines**.

## 7\. Survival Strategy ⑥: Shift to a "Learning with AI" learning strategy

### 7-1. Why You Should Use AI as Your "Study Partner"

We're moving from an era of studying solely through search engines to an era of **studying through conversations with AI**.

- Ununderstanding concepts → Ask AI to explain them in various ways.
- Long documents/papers → Summarize + summarize key concepts + request quiz generation.
- Coding/tool ​​learning → Hand over practice code examples + error analysis to AI.

This reduces the time spent "struggling alone with a book,"

and allows you to **focus more energy on understanding and application.**

### 7-2. Example Study Routines

For example, you can use the following routine when studying a new technology or domain:

1. "Explain this topic to me at a 10-year-old's level, a college student's level, and a professional's level."

2. "Select 10 key keywords and write a one-line definition for each."

3. "Create 10 quiz questions so I can test myself on these concepts." 4. "I'll summarize what I've understood so far, so please give me feedback on any mistakes or ambiguous points."

Using AI not as a simple knowledge provider but as a **personal tutor + coach** significantly increases learning efficiency.

## 8\. Survival Strategy ⑦: Incorporate 'Mental Management' into Your Strategy

### 8-1. Anxiety in the AI ​​Era is a "Normal Reaction"

When watching AI-related news, everyone wonders:

- "Will I still have a job in 10 years?"
- "Will what I'm learning now still be useful in a few years?"

This anxiety is actually a normal reaction. However, **how to transform this anxiety into energy** is crucial.

- Vague fear → Structurally analyze "How exactly will my job change?"
- Thoughts like "I'm falling behind" → Shift to creating a daily AI usage routine, even if it's just 10 minutes.
- Comparison/Anxiety → Set a goal of "Using AI a little better than I did yesterday."

### 8-2. Developing a Personal Strategy from a Long-Term Perspective

The AI ​​era is a marathon. You can't catch up with everything in a short period of time.

Instead, it's helpful to ask yourself these questions:

- What is my **domain expertise** that will still be relevant three years from now?
- How can I integrate AI into that domain to become "indispensable"?
- What will I do to build my **AI utilization skills**, even if only a little each week?

By connecting the answers to these questions to concrete actions (routines, side projects, portfolio improvements, etc.),

AI can become a **career amplifier** rather than a "replacement tool."

## Conclusion: Commonalities of Those Who Survive in the AI ​​Era

In summary, individuals who survive in the AI ​​era have three main things in common:

1. **Understanding**
- A structural understanding of the basic concepts, limitations, and possibilities of AI
- Ability to articulate "how it will impact my work." 2. **Utilization**
- Not just a simple prompt,
- I know how to deconstruct and reassemble my entire work from an AI perspective.
3. **Redesign**
- From resumes and portfolios to workflows and learning methods
- I redesign "with AI in mind."

Surviving in the AI ​​era isn't some special secret strategy.

The key is to "not fear AI, but to embrace a collaborative approach to restructuring our work."

Even if it's just 10 minutes a day, I encourage you to challenge AI with your daily tasks,

and gradually create a version of yourself that works with AI.
