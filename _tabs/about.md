This site focuses on understanding how AI actually works in practice — 
not just what new features are announced.

Rather than rewriting press releases or chasing every update, 
the articles here examine how AI tools, models, and infrastructure 
affect real workflows, decisions, and trade-offs.

Most posts are based on hands-on use, comparison, and analysis.
When a tool sounds impressive but fails in practice, that gap matters.
When an industry trend looks obvious on the surface but hides a constraint,
that structure matters more than hype.

This site is written and maintained by an individual creator.
Opinions are personal and reflect practical judgment, not sponsorship.
The goal is simple: help readers think more clearly about when AI helps,
when it doesn’t, and why.
