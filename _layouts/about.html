    About
  </h1>
  <div>This site focuses on understanding how AI actually works in practice — 
not just what new features are announced.</div>
  <div>Rather than rewriting press releases or chasing every update, 
the articles here examine how AI tools, models, and infrastructure 
affect real workflows, decisions, and trade-offs.</div>
  <div>Most posts are based on hands-on use, comparison, and analysis.
When a tool sounds impressive but fails in practice, that gap matters.
When an industry trend looks obvious on the surface but hides a constraint,
that structure matters more than hype.</div>
  <div>This site is written and maintained by an individual creator.
Opinions are personal and reflect practical judgment, not sponsorship.
The goal is simple: help readers think more clearly about when AI helps,
when it doesn’t, and why.</div>
